Your grace, kindness, and the effortless way you brighten every moment have left an everlasting impression on my heart. I write to you today not just to express my admiration but to share something truly sincere—I care for you deeply. You are someone I hold in the highest regard, someone whose presence turns the ordinary into something truly special. With you, every moment feels meaningful, and every day holds a quiet joy. Apeskha, it would be an honor to walk this journey of life by your side—to support you, to cherish you, and to build a future filled with love and happiness together. So, with all the sincerity in my heart, I ask—will you allow me the privilege of being yours?"
